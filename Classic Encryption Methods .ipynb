    "As defined in [RSA1], an encryption method posesses a novel property being that publicly revealing an encryption key does not reveal the corresponding decryption key. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that keys do not need to be transmitted using secure means, as only the target of such key knows the corresponding decryption key to decipher the message. Furthermore, a message can be signed with a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature, it cannot be tampered with and fakes cannot be forged. \n",

    "These procedures have the following four properties:\n",

    "RSA, which stands for Rivest-Shamir-Adleman, is a widely used public-key cryptosystem that enables secure communication and digital signatures over insecure networks. It was introduced in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, and it remains one of the most widely used and studied encryption algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a high-level explanation of how RSA works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Key Generation:**\n",
    "   - RSA uses a pair of keys: a public key and a private key.\n",
    "   - The public key is used for encryption, and the private key is used for decryption.\n",
    "   - Key generation involves the following steps:\n",
    "      - Choose two large prime numbers, \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n",
    "      - Compute their product \\(n = p \\times q\\). \\(n\\) is used as the modulus for both the public and private keys.\n",
    "      - Calculate Euler's totient function \\(\\phi(n) = (p-1) \\times (q-1)\\), which represents the number of positive integers less than \\(n\\) that are coprime to \\(n\\).\n",
    "      - Choose a public exponent \\(e\\) such that \\(1 < e < \\phi(n)\\) and \\(e\\) is coprime to \\(\\phi(n)\\).\n",
    "      - Calculate the private exponent \\(d\\) such that \\(d \\equiv e^{-1} \\pmod{\\phi(n)}\\), where \\(d\\) is the modular multiplicative inverse of \\(e\\) modulo \\(\\phi(n)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The public key is \\((n, e)\\), and the private key is \\((n, d)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encryption:**\n",
    "   - The sender uses the recipient's public key to encrypt a message.\n",
    "   - Suppose the message is \\(M\\) and the public key is \\((n, e)\\).\n",
    "   - The ciphertext \\(C\\) is computed as \\(C \\equiv M^e \\pmod{n}\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decryption:**\n",
    "   - The recipient uses their private key to decrypt the ciphertext.\n",
    "   - Suppose the ciphertext is \\(C\\) and the private key is \\((n, d)\\).\n",
    "   - The decrypted message \\(M\\) is computed as \\(M \\equiv C^d \\pmod{n}\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "RSA's security is based on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers \\(n = p \\times q\\). Breaking RSA requires factoring \\(n\\) into its prime factors, which becomes computationally infeasible for sufficiently large prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "RSA is commonly used for secure communication, digital signatures, and key exchange in various security protocols and applications. However, the key length used in RSA is critical for its security, and longer key lengths are recommended to withstand advances in computing power and factorization algorithms.\n"

    "Paint example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice and Bob both have private colours, they will use these colours to encrypt their messages so that a third party cannot read the messages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alice and Bob also have a public colour (public key) that everyone is able to see. \n",
    "\n",
    "RSA works like sending open locks, allowing anyone to communicate back to you by closing the lock and sending it back, locked therfore encrypted in our metaphore. Alice has all one private key that opens all of these locks. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay but how does this work for actual code. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Prime number theory: prime numbers have be proven to be the most robust numbers, charting Euler's totent will prove this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what we are doing is creating a private key that is the result of Phi of the factorisation of two prime numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Phi ( p * q) = Phi (p) * Phi (q)\n",
